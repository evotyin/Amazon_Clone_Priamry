# My First Website

This is my first website, created right after learning HTML and CSS. As a beginner in web development, I'm excited to showcase my progress and share my journey with you.

## About Me

My name is Aryan Yadav, and I'm passionate about learning and exploring the world of web development. This website is a reflection of my early skills and knowledge in HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point of the website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styling for the website.

## Getting Started

To view this website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm always eager to learn and improve.

Thank you for visiting my first website!
